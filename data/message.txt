What discordant vespers do the tinkers goods chime through the long twighlight, and over the brindled forest road? Him stooped and hounded through the last windy recrements of day; like those old exiles who divorced of corporeality and enjoined ingress of heaven or hell wander forever the middle warren, spoorless, increate, and anathema. Hounded by grief! Hounded by guilt. Or like this cheerless vendor clamored at heel through wood and fen by his own querulous and inconsolable wares in perennial tin malediction.
